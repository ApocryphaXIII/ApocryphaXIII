  - bugfix: decals like road lines and curbs are now attached to their tile as elements
      rather then objects that sit on top of them. This should result in them layering
      more realistically and responding to things acting upon there turfs (such as
      deleting or replacing)
  - bugfix: turf decals no longer have drop shadows
  - qol: trash on the streets is now cleanable
  - qol: more fluff in the city can be properly damaged
  - refactor: few unrelated refactors to try and speed up init
  - bugfix: changelog uses our server name and credits former vtm servers
  - bugfix: more interfaces use our repo links
